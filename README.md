# Hexapawn

> Uses a monte carlo algorithm to play itself and develop

**Scrabble Solving Application**

- A piece can move forward one square only if that square is empty 
- You can take an opponent's piece if it is in a diagonally neighbouring square (just like a pawn attack in chess) 
- The players take turns to move their pieces
-There are three ways of winning at hexapawn.
1. You get one of your pieces onto the back row on your opponent’s side.
2. You take all of the other player’s pieces.
3. You’ve played the game so that it is impossible for your opponent to make a move (i.e. you have blocked all of their pieces).
